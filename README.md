# opensrp-client-anc
The OpenSRP Antenatal Care (ANC) Reference mobile application digitizes the World Health Organization's (WHO's) latest [ANC guidelines](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/anc-positive-pregnancy-experience/en/) for routine care during pregnancy to ensure a positive outcome and experience for the pregnant woman. 

The application is geared towards ANC healthcare providers at primary healthcare facilities. Healthcare workers use the application to register pregnant women and track their routine care during pregnancy, in accordance with the latest WHO guidelines and recommendations around nutrition and dietary supplementation, maternal and fetal assessment, laboratory testing, and counseling and service provision. 

Countries are meant to use the reference application as a starting point and adapt the module to their context-specific ANC guidelines.
